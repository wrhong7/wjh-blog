            <p>I see our lives as an endless journey of machine learning. It is a trial-and-error.</p>

            <p>Our brain is a complex set of neurological algorithms. We haven't yet fully understood how it works.
            But we can get closer by establishing an artificial order and tweak them until we find out the best combo.
            The order that we are establishing here is our own principles.</p>

            <p>Actions shape our lives. That’s why we need principles that govern our actions.
            Whether we know them or not, our actions are often made through intrinsic principles within our brain.
            After a certain amount of time, if we try to put missing puzzles together, we will soon see the input/output patterns.
            If we see a pattern, we can tweak our own algorithms. Fix some rules, rid of some, and introduce new ones.
            For me, this is an interesting journey of life.</p>

            <p>For that, we need our own principles. Not having a set of principles is worse than having a bad set.
            Bad principles can be fixed, but no principles cannot be fixed.
              More importantly, we need to discover, establish, execute, reflect, and improve our own principles.
            If we don’t execute, we will never know which ones work and which ones do not.</p>

            <p>It is hard to execute our principles since (1) we are governed by our own inertia (or laziness)
            and (2) we don’t always have enough confidence on our own principles.
            These barriers often result in us not having a governing attitude over our lives.
            Some end up spending decades without actually trying to understand what their algorithm is.
            That’s what I am really afraid of.</p>

            <p>Below are the rules that I have been operating with for last six months,
            and it seems to be working well so far. However, as I move forward with my machine-learning process,
            I will tweak, remove, and may even introduce principles that contradicts the ones below.</p>

              It is actually better to Netflix than hanging out with these people.

              I would love to be a gentleman to everyone, but that's hard since our resources, time, and energy are limited.

              Always, always, always remember your family’s birthday, Valentine’s day, best friend’s birthday.
              Surprise them. It is okay to be crazy. Be innovative and become a memorable one.

              There are many definitions of being smart and successful.
              For me, being successful or smart means becoming a high-performer
              while entertaining and energizing people around you.
              At times, stressful moments take place, but as long as you are entertaining and energizing 80% of the time,
              I think people will remember you as a gentleman. <br/>
