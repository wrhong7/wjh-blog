            {/*<p>Our brain is a complex set of neurological algorithms. We haven't yet fully understood how it works.*/}
            {/*But we can get closer by establishing an artificial order and tweak them until we find out the best combo.*/}
            {/*The order that we are establishing here is our own principles.</p>*/}

            {/*<p>Actions shape our lives. That’s why we need principles that govern our actions.*/}
            {/*Whether we know them or not, our actions are often made through intrinsic principles within our brain.*/}
            {/*After a certain amount of time, if we try to put missing puzzles together, we will soon see the input/output patterns.*/}
            {/*If we see a pattern, we can tweak our own algorithms. Fix some rules, rid of some, and introduce new ones.*/}
            {/*For me, this is an interesting journey of life.</p>*/}

            {/*<p>For that, we need our own principles. Not having a set of principles is worse than having a bad set.*/}
            {/*Bad principles can be fixed, but no principles cannot be fixed.*/}
              {/*More importantly, we need to discover, establish, execute, reflect, and improve our own principles.*/}
            {/*If we don’t execute, we will never know which ones work and which ones do not.</p>*/}

            {/*<p>It is hard to execute our principles since (1) we are governed by our own inertia (or laziness)*/}
            {/*and (2) we don’t always have enough confidence on our own principles.*/}
            {/*These barriers often result in us not having a governing attitude over our lives.*/}
            {/*Some end up spending decades without actually trying to understand what their algorithm is.*/}
            {/*That’s what I am really afraid of.</p>*/}

            {/*<p>Below are the rules that I have been operating with for last six months,*/}
            {/*and it seems to be working well so far. However, as I move forward with my machine-learning process,*/}
            {/*I will tweak, remove, and may even introduce principles that contradicts the ones below.</p>*/}

            These are my principles; these can change at any time.
